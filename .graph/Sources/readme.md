>Each kernel Armbian offers has a custom patchset on top which would be impossible to maintain compatibility to each and every kernel version out there. Therefore the choice is usually limited to up to three branches: legacy, current and edge. Depending on board/family the versions behind these branches may differ. You can lookup them in the source code.
